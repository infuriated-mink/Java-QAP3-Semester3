 # Advanced Programming (Java) - Course Assessment

## Introduction
This repository contains the solutions for the Quantitative Assessment Practice as part of the Advanced Programming (Java) course. The assessment is designed to gauge the understanding of the class in terms of the review material covered in the previous weeks. The completion of this assessment is mandatory, and students must complete a minimum of 80% of their assigned QAPs per course.

## Assessment Details
The assessment consists of four problems that cover various aspects of Java programming, including inheritance, abstract classes, and interfaces. The problems are designed to test the students' understanding and ability to apply the concepts learned in the course.

### Problem #1: HighSchool Application
Creation of two new classes, `Teacher` and `CollegeStudent`, extending from `Person` and `Student` classes respectively, with additional properties and methods.

### Problem #2: Class Diagram Implementation
Implementation of classes as shown in a class diagram, including `Point` and `MovablePoint`, with a demo class to show the working of the application.

### Problem #3: Abstract Classes and Shapes
Design of an inheritance hierarchy for shapes (`Ellipse`, `Circle`, `Triangle`, `EquilateralTriangle`) with an abstract superclass `Shape`, and a test class to demonstrate their functionality.

### Problem #4: Interfaces and Scalability
Introduction of a `Scalable` interface and modification of the `Shape` class to implement this interface, with subclasses overriding the `scale` method.

## Deliverables
For each problem, the deliverables include:
- Complete and working class files with proper comments.
- Screenshot of the running codeâ€™s output.

## Repository Structure
The repository is organized by problem number, with each problem's solution in its respective directory:
- `Problem1/`
- `Problem2/`
- `Problem3/`
- `Problem4/`

## Usage
To run the demo classes for each problem, navigate to the problem directory and compile the Java files using `javac`, then run the demo class using `java`.
